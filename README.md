Resume Parsing with YOLOv5 Object Detection This Jupyter notebook demonstrates an innovative approach to resume parsing using YOLOv5, an object detection model. The process involves training the model on a dataset of over 4000 annotated resume images, available on Roboflow. The detected segments are then processed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text information.

Key Features: Object Detection with YOLOv5: The YOLOv5 model is employed to identify and segment different sections of resumes, such as personal details, education, experience, etc.

OCR for Text Extraction: Optical Character Recognition is used to extract text content from the segmented regions, ensuring accurate retrieval of information.

NLP for Cleaning and Parsing: Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to clean and parse the extracted text, enhancing the efficiency of resume analysis.

Usage: Dataset Preparation: Utilize the provided dataset on Roboflow for training the YOLOv5 model.

Training the Model: Follow the notebook instructions to train the YOLOv5 model on the resume dataset.

Segmentation and OCR: After detection, OCR is applied to the segmented regions, extracting relevant text content from resumes.

NLP Processing: Apply NLP techniques for cleaning and parsing the extracted text, making it ready for further analysis.

Requirements: YOLOv5 OCR tools (e.g., Tesseract) Python libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV, spaCy, etc. Feel free to explore and adapt this notebook for your resume parsing needs!
